# Songs-Lyrics-Classification
This repository classifies song lyrics into genres using Apache Spark in a Linux environment. The Spark pipeline includes transformers like Vectorizer, StopWordRemover, CountVectorizer, and Word2Vec. Logistic Regression serves as the estimator for classification. A web application is developed using Streamlit, which also runs the backend server.
